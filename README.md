- 👋 Hi, I’m @safeinschool20

  Hello! I am a high school student living in Texas.

  We live in an era of COVID-19. We see everywhere on the news that the virus is infecting millions of people around the world. And we see that the situation is intense and worsening in the US.

  This channel was created to share information about the COVID-19 pandemic and how students should react to the situation.

  I will try to organize and suggest considerations and precautions for back-to-school in this channel. And also, I hope to get future feedback from you to make an ideal back-to-school protocol for all US students.

  It would be very helpful if you leave informative comments on the videos. Also, if you have any new ideas that I have not covered, please share them there. I will be updating the channel with new videos, so if you have any questions, feel free to ask them in the comments.

  Let’s get through this together.
